# Macroeconomics in the United States

This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis on macroeconomic data from 2002 to 2022 of the United States. We also use the data to train predictive models, and measure their performance. The dataset has been obtained from Kaggle (Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sagarvarandekar/macroeconomic-factors-affecting-us-housing-prices/data), and the csv datafile has also been uploaded in the repository. Both the jupyter notebook as wells as an HTML version of the notebook has been uploaded here.
The Python libraries used are Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and Seaborn.
